## How to contribute

This project uses [Vincent Driessen's branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Consider using the `git-flow` git extensions as described [here](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) to enforce it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mcmunder/eaternity-edb-solution.git
cd eaternity-edb-solution
npm install
```

Start in dev mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Start in production mode:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Package:
```bash
npm run package
```

This project is based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).
